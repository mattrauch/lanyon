This is the new home for all of my posts about all things math, lean, six sigma, and statistics. I will be transitioning my old articles from my [Medium](https://medium.com/@mattrauch) to this site as well while also posting some new content.

## Why did I move here?
Well, good question. Medium looks fantastic, but it doesn't provide much flexibility when it comes to inline equations and code snippets. As the industry has gravitated more and more towards open source software and solutions, I feel this is the best place for me to host my content. 

My interests, as well as my future posts for that matter, have shifted more towards to rapidly expanding field of machine learning and open source software. At the time of writing this, I have become much more invested in Python and R and will be providing code and examples for future posts in each of these languages.
