My professional passion in continuous improvment stems from an interest in statistics and lean. When I run into something interesting that I haven't already found on the internet, I try to write about it here. Hopefully you find my posts helpful.

I admit that I don't have anything profound to contribute, as most of these posts are just analysis of someone else's good idea(s). I'm a believer in the open-source community, and as such, my code on this site and in my GitHub repository is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (GNU AGPLv3), unless otherwise specified.


Speaking of open-source, here are some fun facts about the setup of this project:

* Theme forked from [poole/lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)
* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor

Thanks for reading!
