My name is Matt Rauch. I've been working in the medical device industry for my entire career, mostly in manufacturing. I have a BS in Industrial Technology from San Jose State University, and a Business Minor. I am a certified Project Management Professional (PMP) through Project Management Institute (PMI) and hold a certification from the American Society of Quality (ASQ) as a Certified Six Sigma Black Belt (CSSBB).

My professional passion in continuous improvment stems from an interest in statistics and lean philosphies. When I run into something interesting that I haven't already found on the internet, I try to write about it here. Hopefully you find my posts helpful.

I admit that I don't have anything profound to contribute, as most of these posts are just analysis of someone else's good idea(s). I'm a believe in the open-source community, and as such, my code on this site and in my GitHub repository is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (GNU AGPLv3), unless otherwise specified.


Speaking of open-source, here are some fun facts about the setup of this project:

* Theme forked from [poole/lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)
* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor

Thanks for reading!
