I recently took a Project Management Professional (PMP) course that covered cost and schedule estimation. According to Project Management Insitute's (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), statistically based estimate methods can be either parametric estimation or three-point estimate[^fn1].

Parametric estimation, as you may have guessed, involve using the normal distribution. However, the methodology in PMBOK is not so scientific. Parametric estimation in their case is simply using linear estimation to predict a future cost. An example of this would be if Project X used $10$ widgets at a cost of $\$10$ each, and our project uses $20$ widgets, we estimate the cost to be $\$20$. Not so scientific, but certainly appropriate in certain situations.
