I’m a huge fan of Chipotle. With soaring stock, [CMG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CMG) has been the focus of well-earned attention in recent and [not so recent](https://qz.com/200901/chipotle-continues-to-refine-the-science-of-burrito-velocity/) news. Besides delicious food, part of Chipotle’s success has been attributed to their efforts in the development and improvement of the so-called burrito assembly line. In fact, some of Chipotle’s [fastest](http://qz.com/172900/how-chipotle-is-going-to-serve-burritos-faster-and-faster-and-faster/) restaurants churn out over 350 transactions per hour at peak time — that’s about one transaction every 10 seconds. Chipotle talks specifically about their [“four pillars of great throughput”](http://qz.com/172900/how-chipotle-is-going-to-serve-burritos-faster-and-faster-and-faster/) as a key to this type of performance — more on that later.

Hearing “pillars” and “throughput” from a fast food executive in the same sentence may make investors and engineers alike giddy, but empirical evidence gathered from personal experiences would place 350 transactions per hour somewhere between generous and outrageous. It would appear that most locations are over-staffed, have long queues, and tend to lack the elusive flow Industrial Engineers strive for in a balanced process.

As bold as the last statement may be, the fast food industry is notoriously plagued by lack of flow caused by system bottlenecks. The usual response to this is by throwing more people into the bottleneck process, which usually lowers cycle time at that station and leaves people under-utilized across the system. This combination tends to stress employees out, throwing off-balance even more. The simple and visual nature of Chipotle’s assembly line makes this painfully obvious, which to their credit may have been inspired by the company mission to continuously improve. Fortunately, and again to Chipotle’s credit, senior executives have expressed confidence that throughput can be further improved, despite the alleged performance already reported.

Recall the 350 transactions per second claim, and redirect your attention on how Chipotle credit’s its performance improvements. From their perspective, what set’s them apart are these “four pillars of great throughput” mentioned earlier. This is best explained from an article on Quartz.com quoting CEO Steve Ells:

> **Expediters**: That would be the extra person between the one who rolls your burrito and the one who rings up your order. Her job? Getting your drink, asking whether your order is for here or to go, and bagging your food.
> 
> **Linebackers**: The people who patrol the countertops, serving-ware, and bins of food, so the ones who are actually serving customers never turn their backs on them.
> 
> **Mise en place**: What in a regular restaurant means setting out ingredients and utensils ready for use means, in Chipotle’s case, zero tolerance for not having absolutely everything in place ahead of lunch and dinner rush hours.
> 
> **Aces in their places**: A commitment to having what each branch considers its top servers in the most important positions at peak times, so there are no trainees working at burrito rush hour.

The problem with these roles is they focus on the system as having a people problem, i.e., the system is optimized to a state that only improvements can be made by adding for people.

Next time you are at Chipotle, pay attention to any wait times that you experience from station to station. Pay attention to the bottlenecks that occur within the line, and where the food tends to build up as ingredients are added. Think about the 10 second takt time the system is designed for — do all stations take advantage of that 10 seconds before passing to the next station? Last, look at the sources of variability within the system. Are these sources of variability from human error or because the humans don’t have standard tools and methods to consistently perform their task correctly?

This may all come off as being overly harsh. After all, Chipotle’s focus on delivering a delicious product in an efficient manner has gained the loyalty of millions of customers and certainly the attention of Wall Street. The point here is that one aspect of true continuous improvement is realized by focusing on systems and how they better utilize the humans that operate them, not the other way around. Why does Chipotle need “expediters” and “linebackers”? A lean approach would ask what is preventing the staff at each station for performing the full gamut of responsibilities in the first place.
